== Kannemann-Becke set KB49 ==

The Kannemann-Becke set was proposed in full in
<cite>kannemann2010</cite> but many of the data in the article has
undergone a number of revisions. We typically use a subset (KB49), which
contains 49 dimers without the noble-gas dimers. The KB49 set contains:

# The S22 set by Jurecka et al. <cite>jurecka2006</cite>, revised by Marshall et al. <cite>marshall2011</cite> (S22).
# The complexes from the set proposed by Zhao and Truhlar <cite>zhao2005</cite> (ZT).
# The complexes from Johnson and Becke <cite>c6br,c6sequel,xdmc6810</cite> which in turn comprise a mixture from several other literature soruces (JB).

The most recent reference binding energies (BEs) are given in the table
below, together with the level of calculation, the appropriate
references to the literature, and the xyz files for the dimer (dm) and
the two monomers (m1 and m2). In the references column, the first
citation (in bold) corresponds to the actual article where the BE can be
found. UP means "unpublished result". In some of the S22 dimers,
Marshall et al. obtained the reference BE by combining previous results.
For simplicity, we cite their article (<cite>marshall2011</cite>) as the
primary reference and the base sources after it. The latest data for all
the dimers except the noble gases can be consulted in reference
<cite>xdmbasis</cite>.

All binding energies are in kcal/mol and the coordinates in the xyz
files are in angstrom. 

Regarding the nomenclature for the level, aXZ stands for aug-cc-pVXZ and
haXZ stands for heavy-aug-cc-pVXZ. MB represent mid-bond basis
functions. CP is Boys-Bernardi Counterpoise (CP) correction
<cite>boys1970</cite> and half-CP corersponds to using only half of the
actual CP correction to the binding energy, as described in
<cite>mackie2011</cite>. The two CBS methods used in our dimers are
Martin <cite>martin1996</cite> and Helgaker <cite>halkier1998</cite>
extrapolation formulae. The Δ symbol means that only the difference
between the following and the preceding level of theories was
calculated. For instance,

: MP2-CP/CBS(Helgaker)/ha(Q,5)Z+ΔCCSD(T)-CP/(aTZ+MB)

means MP2 with CP correction extrapolated to the CBS limit using
Helgaker formula and the bases heavy-aug-pVQZ/heavy-aug-pV5Z for the
two-point extrapolation. On top of the MP2 energy, the difference
between CCSD(T) and MP2 energies is added, calculated at aug-cc-pVTZ
(plus mid-bond basis functions) and using the CP correction. See [[Tale
8]] for more information on extrapolation formulas and composite
approaches.
